# ospd-ikescan

[![Scrutinizer Code Quality](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/greenbone/ospd-ikescan/badges/quality-score.png?b=master)](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/greenbone/ospd-ikescan/?branch=master)

This is an OSP server implementation to allow GVM to remotely control
an `ike-scan` scanner, see <https://github.com/royhills/ike-scan>.

`ospd-ikescan` tries to identify IPSEC VPN endpoints. It will attempt to
enumerate supported cipher suites, bruteforce valid groupnames and fingerprint
any endpoint identified.

Once running, you need to configure the Scanner for Greenbone Vulnerability
Manager, for example via the web interface Greenbone Security Assistant.
Then you can create scan tasks to use this scanner.
